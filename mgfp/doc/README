--[ 1. Introduction ]------------------------------------------------

This is a flex/bison-C++ parser. The MGF grammar is located
in Parser.ypp, the scanner configuration in Scanner.ll.
The code is based on the basic template provided by Timo 
Bingmann (http://idlebox.net/2007/flex-bison-cpp-example/).

Makefile.createParser holds the flex/bison commands that will
create the necessary .cpp, .hpp, and .hh files. The whole
thing is wrapped as a static library which should ease the
independent distribution process. W.r.t. SVN versions, be aware
that in order to compile on any system (assuming a stable
MGF grammar but getting rid of depending on bison/flex availability),
the scanner and parser are pre-generated. This should in general not 
be a problem.

If you run into problems, try to solve them and send patches (and
questions, if need be) to
    Marc Kirchner <marc.kirchner@iwr.uni-heidelberg.de>

--[ 2. Licensing ]---------------------------------------------------

Long story (see below) short: we fall back to the 'special exception'
in the bison-generated code, make full use of the freedom of the 
WTF Public License and declare everything to follow the licensing
scheme of the respective ms++ implementation.

The details: There are file-wise licensing issues:

    As a special exception, you may create a larger work that contains
    part or all of the Bison parser skeleton and distribute that work
    under terms of your choice, so long as that work isn't itself a
    parser generator using the skeleton or a modified version thereof
    as a parser skeleton.  Alternatively, if you modify or redistribute
    the parser skeleton itself, you may (at your option) remove this
    special exception, which will cause the skeleton and the resulting
    Bison output files to be licensed under the GNU General Public
    License without this special exception.

    This special exception was added by the Free Software Foundation in
    version 2.2 of Bison.


* Scanner.cpp
    This file is generated using 'flex'. I was unable to find out what
    licensing implications this bears. As there are no comments whatsoever
    in the code, I'd assume that code generated using 'flex' should be
    under the licensing scheme chosen by the author of the Scanner.ll file.
    If that is the case, Scanner.cpp will be under the same license as 
    Scanner.ll.

* CMakeLists.txt
* Context.cpp
* Context.h
* Driver.cpp
* Driver.h
* Makefile.createParser
* Nodes.h
* Parser.ypp

    The original versions (from Timo Bingmann's basic template) of these
    files were distributed under the WTFPL:

    Now being part of ms++, all of these files have been moved to the ms++
    licensing scheme. Plese refere to the LICENSE file in the ms++ top level
    directory for details.
